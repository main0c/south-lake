/// An inspector must be an instance of NSViewController that has an icon

/// There are two kinds of inspectors: model inspectors and editor inspectors.
///
/// A model inspector needs access to the file object. The data it shows and which
/// it allows the user to edit depend only on the model. An example of a file
/// inspector is the metadata inspector. A file inspector does not have access to
/// the file's editor instance.
///
/// An editor inspector works with the visual editor for a file and so needs access
/// to that interface (FileEditor protocol). An editor inspector doesn't have default
/// access to the file, although an editor can provide that. An example editor
/// inspector is a PDF thumbnail view that requires access to the PDF viewer
/// to display thumbnails and scroll the viewer when a thumbnail is selected.
