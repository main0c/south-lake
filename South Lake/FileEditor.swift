//  TODO: mark FileEditor protocol as always belonging to class NSViewController

//  Architecture
//  Should we share the File or just the data?
//  Sharing the data shares less and makes the class more resilient to change
//  Sharing the File may allow us to have more complex editor views
//  For example, allowing local edits to change the title or metadata

//  TODO: blows up when I make available to @objc(FileEditor)
